<h1>In recent years with the rapid development of the electrical vehicle (EV) of new energy industry, higher requirements are put forward for convenience, safety and reliability of the charging of electric vehicles.
 Wireless power charging is done by inductive coupling. Inductive coupling can done in both stationary and dynamic conditions. By reconfiguring the transformer and altering high frequency, energy is being transferred with low energy loss and fewer demands on the primary circuit. Sufficient power for the battery can be transferred by the primary to the secondary without sufficient energy loss. Electric power is then transmitted to the chargeable battery which is electrically coupled to the secondary circuit through the air core transformer. In case of shuttle bus services, buses can be charged when it waits at bus station. It can also be implemented in rental taxi parking. Thus the battery in electric buses only needs enough charge to go to the next stop. 
This decreases the battery size and promotes significant cost saving in electric vehicles. This technology enables efficient opportunities in charging stations, for predefined routes and planned stops reducing down the time of charging. The dynamic charging will promote the use of electric vehicles and reduce petroleum fuel consumption. Delays in traffic signals can now be provided with longer periods of charging and even when the electric vehicle is in movement. Bad weather conditions like rain and snow do not affect the charging capabilities of electric vehicles.
